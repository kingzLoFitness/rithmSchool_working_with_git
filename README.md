This is just an example of editing README.md from another tutorial with working with Git in my notebook (as I look back and forth within tutorials.  In that sense, 

- notes from "The Odin Project's version of working with GIT (I still need to practice and take more notes about GIT.  In due time within ProGit book for it looks promising with notes and all to take)).  

I still need to work on Markdown (coming soon in the look and feel in the writing in up and coming README.md files).
